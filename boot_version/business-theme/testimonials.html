		    <h4><strong>Executive Coach, mother of 3</strong></h4>
		    <p>"As a parent of three children with ADHD and being a certified Executive Coach myself, I see first-hand how transformative coaching is with adults, teens and children. The process, skills and methodologies of coaching are tailor-made for the challenges that come with ADHD and bringing forth an individual’s strengths as well.</p>
		     
		    <p>My 11 yr old started working with Kathleen on organizational and study skills, and within a few sessions he was more enthusiastic, engaged and conscientious about his academics. Through good communication, Kathleen helped him uncover areas of challenge and started giving him the tools to be more successful. I quickly noticed an increase in his confidence and received an email from his teacher also noticing positive changes.</p>
		      
		      <p>Kathleen’s demeanor has a calming and empowering influence on my son.  He is more knowledgeable about ADHD and has a positive attitude about it, school and himself.  Afternoon can be tricky for kids with ADHD and when Kathleen comes through the door, he slows down and can focus in a relaxed way. I highly recommend working with Kathleen…she’s been a blessing to our family!"</p>

		    <h4><strong>30 yr. old PhD student at Johns Hopkins</strong></h4>
		    <p>"Working with Kathleen has brought a sustained, concentrated, and positive focus on the executive functioning aspect of my life. This has been extremely helpful as I have gradually worked on developing the skill to clarifying my priorities. I've discovered my habit of unintentionally getting lost in distraction and mismanaging my time were largely symptomatic of the difficulty and the overwhelm I had when I attempted to plan out my day or week. For years, my lack of both confidence and practice in this area, as well as the anxiety I felt about making the "wrong" choice, would paralyze me or drive me to flit from one thing to another without a lot of deliberate thought. Recognizing this and having Kathleen assist me to sustain my attention on the topic at hand, despite my discomfort, has been eye opening. I no longer get caught up and worried about making the "wrong" decision with respect to my priorities. I now realize, making a decision and adjusting as needed is better than not making any decision. Throughout this process, Kathleen has been extremely flexible and adaptable."<p>
