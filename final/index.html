		    <h3>Partnership</h3>
		    <p>Making a commitment to work with a coach is 
		    an important investment in yourself.  Through 
		    this partnership, we will work together and 
		    identify your needs, challenges and goals. 
		    The client and coach work collaboratively to 
		    achieve the desired outcomes you want for yourself.			   
		    The client creates the agenda for each meeting, 
		    which typically occurs once a week.</p>  

		    <h3>Process</h3>
		    <p>As we move through our sessions we will strategize 
		    and reflect on sought after goals.  I will use 
		    powerful questioning to help you dig deeper and 
		    to create opportunities for you to challenge 
		    yourself.  With the use of direct and effective 
		    communication we will establish a dialogue and 
		    discussion which will lead you to greater 
		    empowerment.</p>

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Kathleen is a mother of three teenage/young 
			adult children who have all been impacted by 
			ADD to varying degrees.  She has invested 
			extensive time	and resources over the years 
			researching ADD by
			conferring with other professionals, attending 
			lectures on ADD and reading books on the 
			subject.  Her most recent education on 
			ADD/ADHD came in the form of formal coach 
			training.  This was completed through an 
			accredited ADD coaching school ADDCA - ADD 
			Coach Academy.   ADDCA is a coaching school 
			recognized by the governing body ICF - 
			International Coach Federation of which she 
			is a member. </p>

			<p>Kathleen’s undergraduate studies were completed
			at Towson State University where she received 
			a BS in General Education. 
			For the past three years she has coached adults
			as well as students from college age down to
			elementary school age. She has also hosted 
			presentations on ADD/ADHD and has worked in the
			public school system working with elementary

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>How does the ADHD coaching relationship work?</h3>
			<p>
			Coaching starts with a phone conversation to assess the clients particular 
			challenges and determine the clients needs and desired outcomes. The coach 
			& client meet weekly, scheduling a mutually agreed upon time that takes 
			place either in person or by phone. The client brings the agenda of what he 
			or she would like to focus on for each appointment while the coach supports 
			the client by customizing strategies that help ensure the client finds success.
			</p>
			<h3>How do I know if I’m ready for ADHD/ADD coaching?</h3>
			<p>
			If you are ready to make positive changes in your life and you are looking to 
			experience growth, be it personal, professional, or relational than coaching 
			is right for you. Clients need to possess a commitment to be open to new 
			ideas, strategies and approaches. They also need to be willing to implement 
			the needed action steps to create the positive growth they desire.
			</p>
			<h3>How long does the coaching relationship last?</h3>
			<p>
			The length of the coaching relationship varies depending on the scope of the 
			client’s needs and goals. I ask all clients to consider a 3 month commitment 
			in order establish a working relationship and to promote noticeable change 
			and progress. Many clients notice, the longer they are committed to the 
			coaching process, the more results they achieve.
