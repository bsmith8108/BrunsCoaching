		    <h3>Partnership</h3>
		    <p>Making a commitment to work with a coach is 
		    an important investment in yourself.  Through 
		    this partnership, we will work together and 
		    identify your needs, challenges and goals. 
		    The client and coach work collaboratively to 
		    achieve the desired outcomes you want for yourself.			   
		    The client creates the agenda for each meeting, 
		    which typically occurs once a week.</p>  

		    <h3>Process</h3>
		    <p>As we move through our sessions we will strategize 
		    and reflect on sought after goals.  I will use 
		    powerful questioning to help you dig deeper and 
		    to create opportunities for you to challenge 
		    yourself.  With the use of direct and effective 
		    communication we will establish a dialogue and 
		    discussion which will lead you to greater 
		    empowerment.</p>
