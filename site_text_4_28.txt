The Partnership & the Process

Partnership
Making a commitment to work with a coach is an important investment in yourself.  Through this partnership, we will work together and identify your needs, challenges and goals. The client and coach work collaboratively to achieve the desired outcomes you want for yourself.  The client creates the agenda for each meeting, which typically occurs once a week.  


Process
As we move through our sessions we will strategize and reflect on sought after goals.  I will use powerful questioning to help you dig deeper and to create opportunities for you to challenge yourself.  With the use of direct and effective communication we will establish a dialogue and discussion which will lead you to greater empowerment.
